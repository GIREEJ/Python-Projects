                High Score Tracking:
                The game loads the current high score from a file using load_high_score and saves new high scores with save_high_score.
                
                Remaining Attempts:
                After each guess, the game shows the remaining number of attempts.
                
                Replayability:
                After a game, players can choose to play again, and the high score will be updated if a new one is achieved.

This enhanced version of the "Guess the Number" game is more engaging, and the high score feature encourages competition and replayability.
